## Project Overview

This repository is the ninth project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team. 

The ability to accurately and timely recognize critical objects and behaviors in images is limited by the training datasets currently available, which do not fully represent the variability and complexity of real-world situations.

Benefits:
- Expanding the dataset using advanced Data Augmentation techniques will improve the accuracy of the image recognition system.
- By automating the process of generating new data through the creation of varied images and texts, operational efficiency will be optimized.
- Using advanced deep learning and data generation techniques with Generative AI will drive innovation.

Project steps and information:
* Dataset
    - Use the OxfordIIITPet dataset from PyTorch as the basis for the project to improve the image recognition system.
* Image Captioning and Data Generation
    - Apply image captioning to create initial descriptions of the images.
    - Then, use generative models to create variants of the images and texts, thus enriching the dataset with artificially generated data.
* Model Training:
    - Train an image recognition model using the extended dataset, evaluating the quality of the data produced and comparing the performance of the model on the reduced and augmented datasets.
* Performance Evaluation:
    - Measure accuracy, precision, recall and other performance metrics to compare the trained model on both datasets.
* Results Analysis:
    - Comment on the differences in performance and the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques in improving the accuracy of the model in real-world critical infrastructure security contexts.
